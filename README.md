# Jammehcow.KeyedOptions

`KeyedOptions` is a small library aimed to reduce code duplication (specifically binding with keys) when registering `IOptions` in .NET

## Why?

I've used this chunk of code in a few work projects and found myself needing it in personal ones too.
You might think this isn't worth creating a package for, but here it is!
